# Final Fantasy Sound Effects System

## Overview
The FF Sound Effects system provides a non-invasive audio layer that enhances the FFTCG Simulator with authentic Final Fantasy sounds. It is designed to be completely optional and disabled by default to preserve the existing game mechanics.

## Design Principles
- **Non-Invasive**: Does not interfere with existing game logic
- **Optional**: Disabled by default, user can enable in Profile settings
- **Lightweight**: Only loads when activated
- **Backwards Compatible**: Works with existing UI without modifications

## File Structure
```
src/components/
â”œâ”€â”€ FFSoundEffects.js          # Main sound system class
â””â”€â”€ FF_SOUND_EFFECTS_README.md # This documentation
```

## Integration Points

### 1. System Initialization
```javascript
// In main.js constructor
this.soundEffects = null;
this.initializeSoundEffects();
```

### 2. User Settings
Located in Profile View (`profileView`):
- Enable/Disable toggle
- Volume slider
- Settings persist in localStorage

### 3. Sound Categories

#### Menu Sounds
- `menu-select`: Hover over menu items
- `menu-confirm`: Button clicks, confirmations
- `menu-cancel`: Cancel actions, back buttons
- `menu-error`: Error notifications

#### Card Sounds
- `card-draw`: Drawing cards from deck
- `card-play`: Playing cards to field
- `card-hover`: Hovering over cards

#### Game Sounds
- `game-start`: Beginning of game
- `turn-change`: Turn transitions
- `victory`: Player wins
- `defeat`: Player loses

## Usage Examples

### Playing Sounds
```javascript
// Anywhere in the application
if (window.ffSounds) {
    window.ffSounds.play('menu-confirm');
}

// Or via app instance
if (window.app?.soundEffects) {
    window.app.soundEffects.play('card-draw');
}
```

### Game Integration
```javascript
// In existing game code, add these calls:
window.app?.soundEffects?.onGameStart();
window.app?.soundEffects?.onTurnChange();
window.app?.soundEffects?.onCardPlay();
```

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed
- [x] Base FFSoundEffects class structure
- [x] System initialization in main.js
- [x] User settings UI in Profile view
- [x] LocalStorage persistence
- [x] Non-invasive integration approach

### ðŸ”„ Placeholder/Future Work
- [ ] Actual audio file loading
- [ ] Web Audio API implementation
- [ ] FF-themed sound file assets
- [ ] Integration with existing game events
- [ ] Advanced audio features (fade, 3D positioning)

## Adding Sound Files

When implementing actual audio:

1. Create `/assets/audio/` directory
2. Add FF-themed sound files (preferably .ogg format for web compatibility)
3. Update sound file paths in `FFSoundEffects.loadSounds()`
4. Implement actual audio playback in `play()` method

## Performance Considerations

- Audio files only load when system is enabled
- Uses Web Audio API for efficient playback
- Sounds are cached after first load
- Volume control prevents audio clipping

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with Web Audio API support
- Fallbacks for older browsers (graceful degradation)
- Mobile device considerations for audio autoplay policies

## Testing

To test the sound system:

1. Enable sounds in Profile â†’ Audio Settings
2. Check browser console for sound system logs
3. Interact with UI elements to trigger sound events
4. Verify settings persist after page reload

## Customization

Users can:
- Enable/disable the entire system
- Adjust volume (0-100%)
- Settings are preserved across sessions

Developers can:
- Add new sound categories
- Modify integration points
- Extend with visual feedback (sound visualizers)

## Notes for Developers

- System is disabled by default - no performance impact
- All sound calls are safe even when system is disabled
- Console logging helps debug sound events
- Easy to extend with additional sound categories
- Designed to work alongside existing game mechanics
