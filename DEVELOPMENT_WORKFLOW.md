  - Card playing and ability resolution
  - Combat system with attack/block mechanics
  - CP (Crystal Point) generation and management
  - Stack-based ability resolution
  - Victory condition checking
  - EX Burst support
  - Game state persistence

- **Card Database** (`js/core/CardDatabase.js`): Comprehensive card management system:
  - Card data storage and retrieval
  - Search and filtering functionality
  - Deck validation according to FFTCG rules
  - Sample card data with all 8 elements
  - Element and type categorization
  - Local storage persistence

- **Deck Manager** (`js/core/DeckManager.js`): Full deck building functionality:
  - Create, save, load, and delete decks
  - Deck validation and statistics
  - Import/export in multiple formats (JSON, text, CSV)
  - Random deck generation
  - Deck suggestions and analysis

### ✅ User Interface
- **Main Layout** (`index.html`): Complete application structure with:
  - Navigation system with Home, Game, Deck Builder, Profile views
  - Loading screen with progress tracking
  - Modal system for dialogs
  - Responsive grid layouts

- **Component System**: Framework for UI components including:
  - Modal components
  - Deck builder interface
  - Lobby system (structure)

### ✅ Player Management
- **Player Manager** (`js/core/PlayerManager.js`): Referenced but not yet examined
- Profile system with stats tracking
- Game history and performance metrics

### ✅ Networking Foundation
- **Socket Client**: Structure for multiplayer connectivity
- Offline/online mode detection
- Server connection handling

## Architecture Highlights

### Modular Design
- Clear separation of concerns with dedicated modules
- Event-driven architecture with custom event systems
- Dependency injection for loose coupling

### FFTCG Rules Implementation
- Complete phase structure following official rules
- Proper damage and CP systems
- Element-based deck building constraints
- 50-card deck requirement with 3-copy limits

### Data Management
- Local storage for persistence
- Card database with search capabilities
- Deck import/export functionality
- Version migration support
