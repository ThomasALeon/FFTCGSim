# ðŸš€ Git Push Instructions for FFTCG Simulator

## Current Status
âœ… **All code is committed locally** - 3 commits ready to push
âœ… **Working tree is clean** - no uncommitted changes
âœ… **Remote configured correctly** - pointing to https://github.com/ThomasALeon/FFTCGSim.git

## Issue
The push is failing due to GitHub authentication requirements. GitHub no longer accepts username/password authentication for HTTPS operations.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use Personal Access Token (Easiest)

1. **Create a Personal Access Token on GitHub:**
   - Go to GitHub.com â†’ Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens â†’ Tokens (classic)
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a descriptive name like "FFTCG Simulator Development"
   - Select scopes: `repo` (full repository access)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again)

2. **Push with the token:**
   ```bash
   git push https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/ThomasALeon/FFTCGSim.git main
   ```

3. **Or set up credential storage:**
   ```bash
   git config credential.helper store
   git push origin main
   # When prompted, use your GitHub username and the token as password
   ```

### Option 2: Switch to SSH (More Secure)

1. **Generate SSH key (if you don't have one):**
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
   ```

2. **Add SSH key to GitHub:**
   - Copy the public key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
   - Go to GitHub.com â†’ Settings â†’ SSH and GPG keys â†’ New SSH key
   - Paste the key and save

3. **Change remote to SSH:**
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:ThomasALeon/FFTCGSim.git
   git push origin main
   ```

### Option 3: Use GitHub CLI

1. **Install GitHub CLI:**
   ```bash
   brew install gh  # macOS
   ```

2. **Authenticate:**
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```

3. **Push:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

## Verification Commands

After successful push, verify with:
```bash
git status                    # Should say "up to date with origin/main"
git log --oneline origin/main # Should show all 4 commits including initial
```
