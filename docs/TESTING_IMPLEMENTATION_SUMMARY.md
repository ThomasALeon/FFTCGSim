- **Integration tests** between components
- **Real-world scenarios** with actual card data
- **Performance benchmarks** and memory usage tracking
- **Automated validation** of business rules and constraints

### ‚úÖ Test Runner Interface (`test.html`)
- **Interactive test execution** with real-time progress
- **Filtered test runs** (utilities only, core systems only)
- **Visual feedback** with color-coded results
- **Export capabilities** for test results and logs
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for developer efficiency

### ‚úÖ Development Integration (`js/main.js` updates)
- **Seamless integration** of all new utilities
- **Enhanced error handling** with actionable notifications
- **Development mode detection** with automatic debug tools
- **Global debugging helpers** accessible via console
- **Performance monitoring** throughout application lifecycle

## üöÄ How to Use the Testing System

### Quick Testing
```bash
# Open the main application with debug mode
open index.html
# Or serve with a local server
npx live-server .
```

### Comprehensive Testing
```bash
# Open the full test suite
open test.html
# Run tests programmatically
window.runTests()
```

### Development Debugging
```javascript
// Available in browser console when in development mode:
debug.showStats()           // View application statistics
debug.testCard('ff1-001-h') // Test card retrieval
debug.testDeck()           // Create test deck
debug.clearData()          // Clear all stored data
debug.exportData()         // Export application data
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Logger overlay appears in development mode
- [ ] Notifications show with different types and animations
- [ ] LocalStorage persists data between sessions
- [ ] Card database loads with 70+ cards
- [ ] Deck manager can create, save, and validate decks
- [ ] Validation catches errors and provides helpful messages
- [ ] Test suite runs without errors
- [ ] All utilities integrate properly with main application

## üéØ Git Workflow Status

### Current State
- ‚úÖ All new code committed to local repository
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive commit message with change details
- ‚è≥ **Ready for manual push** to origin/main

### To Push Changes
```bash
# You'll need to push manually with authentication:
git push origin main

# If you need to authenticate, you may need to:
# 1. Set up SSH keys, or
# 2. Use a personal access token, or  
# 3. Use GitHub CLI: gh auth login
```
