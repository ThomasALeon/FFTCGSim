# Final Fantasy TCG Simulator - Comprehensive Project Tasks

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the complete roadmap for the FFTCG Simulator, transitioning from a proof-of-concept with file-based storage to a scalable platform capable of supporting hundreds of millions of users. The project is currently in a strong technical position with robust data import systems and needs strategic refactoring for enterprise-scale deployment.

## Current Status Overview

### ✅ Recently Completed (Last Development Cycle)
- **Complete Card Database**: 3,853 cards across all Opus 1-26 sets
- **Deck Import System**: 100% success rate for Materia Hunter format imports
- **Image Management**: Dual-source system (Materia Hunter + Square Enix fallback) 
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and user feedback systems
- **Testing Framework**: Automated test suites for deck import validation
- **Database Tooling**: Python automation for card data fetching and maintenance

### ⚠️ Current Technical Debt
- File-based data storage (JSON) - **Critical scalability blocker**
- Complex game board with unnecessary zones
- Synchronous initialization patterns causing race conditions
- No horizontal scaling architecture
- Limited error recovery and fault tolerance

## Phase 1: Core Architecture Redesign (4-6 weeks)

### 1.1 Database Migration Strategy
**Priority: CRITICAL** | **Effort: High** | **Risk: Medium**

#### Requirements Analysis
- **Scale Target**: 100M+ users, 1B+ games, 10M+ concurrent users
- **Data Types**: Cards (static), Users, Decks, Games, Matches, Analytics
- **Performance**: <100ms queries, 99.9% uptime, global distribution

#### Database Selection Criteria
```markdown
**Option A: PostgreSQL + Redis**
- ✅ ACID compliance for critical game state
- ✅ Complex queries for deck analysis and matchmaking
